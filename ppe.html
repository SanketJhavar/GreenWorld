        Binish Desai’s latest invention — Brick 2.0 — comes at a time when the plastic crisis has
        snowballed the world over. The ‘Recycle Man of India’, who shot to fame in 2010 for
        designing P-Block (bricks from industrial paper and gum waste), spent the last few months
        working on converting discarded face-masks into bricks and is now gearing up for
        commercial production.</p>

            which he created when he was aged ten. “Initially, everyone was talking about how the
            lockdown had helped reduce pollution, but I could only think of what the rising demand for
            PPE suits and masks would lead to,” says the founder of the Gujarat-based Eco-Eclectic
            Technologies, who has always focused on recycling neglected waste material.</p>

          <p class="card-text mb-auto" style="font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">In April, when the lockdown began, Desai, 27, He started studying the material the masks are made of, a non-woven fibre, by collecting
            used masks from his family. “I dumped them in a bucket of disinfectant for two days before
            starting work,” says Desai. He then mixed them with “special binders” created in his lab.
            
            “To check the material’s tenacity I conducted small prototype experiments and explored
            various combinations of binders. For these bricks, the successful ratio was 52% PPE + 45%
            paper waste + 3% binder,” says Desai, who has been featured in the Forbes ‘30 Under 30’
            Asia 2018 list of successful social entrepreneurs.
            
            Each brick is 12 x 8 x 4 inches in size, and it uses 7 kg of biomedical waste per square foot.
            Binish claims it is lighter, and stronger compared to the P-Block 1.0. It is also waterproof and
            fire-resistant, and costs Rs 2.8 per piece.</p>

        Binish hopes to start full-fledged manufacturing from September, and source the biomedical
waste from hospitals, schools, salons, bus stops, and other public places by placing ‘Eco
Bins’. These are meant only to collect non-woven PPE waste.
<br><br>
The bins will have an indication mark to show that it is full. Once it reaches that mark, the
waste is left untouched for the next 72 hours, and then it will be disinfected thoroughly. Once
that is done, it is shredded, added along with paper sludge and the binding agent.
<br><br>
“We are in the process of obtaining NOC (no objection certificate) and collaborating with
government institutions to set up the bins in public spaces with high footfall,” he says.
<br><br>
Lakshmi Menon, an eco-innovator based in Ernakulam, Kerala, and the founder of Shayyas
— beds made from scraps of the material used to make PPE gowns — says “These kinds of
innovations are the need of the hour. The pandemic has given way for a new kind of waste
to get accumulated, and ideas like these are what will protect the environment from getting
even dirtier. Whenever there is a crisis, there is also an opportunity hidden in it.”
<br><br>
After following proper sanitation protocols, the material will be shredded, added to industrial
paper waste procured from paper mills, and then mixed with binder. “The mix is kept for 5-6
hours before being set in moulds. The bricks are naturally dried for three days and the
product is then ready for use,” he says.
<br><br>
Safety and hygiene are paramount when dealing with medical waste, and Desai explains
that they follow Central Pollution Control Board guidelines. PPE waste must be kept
untouched for 72 hours before disposal, says Desai, “so the Eco Bins will be opened 72
hours later and the waste will first be washed in a pool of disinfectant.”
<br><br>
 Desai’s team has worked with 106 different types of waste (jewellery units, textile scraps,
paper surplus, coffee waste, etc.) to create over 180 products such as wall and acoustic
panels, paver blocks, home décor artefacts, and more. “This non-woven material falls under
the ‘biomedical’ category, but once sanitised it is easy to handle compared to products such
as diapers and surgical gloves,” he says, adding that he is also looking at recycling PPE kits.
<br><br>
Desai compares the bricks with AAC blocks, red bricks and his P-Block, which has been
used to construct toilets and houses across Gujarat and Maharashtra, and in Hyderabad and
Varanasi. “The new variant, Brick 2.0, is stronger and more durable, which makes it three
times stronger than conventional bricks at twice the size and half the price,” he says, adding
that it is fire retardant, recyclable and absorbs less than 10% water.
<br><br>
“The project is currently at the commercial stage as we already have the infrastructure for P-
Block, and we will only add a few steps for the 2.0 variant,” says Desai, who plans to start
production from mid-September.
<br>
<br>
The new bricks will be sold at ₹2.8 per piece. Desai says he has started receiving enquiries
and pre-orders from architects and interior designers. <br>
