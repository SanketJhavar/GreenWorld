              <h3 class="card-title" style="font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;font-weight: bold;">The Beginning</h3>
              <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif">Have you ever eaten a coconut? Of course, you have. But what part of coconut do you eat? Of course, the white part, and then you throw the shell of coconut away!
            <br><br>
            This is a brilliant way for restaurants and eateries over the globe to
            eliminate the use of plastic bowls/china made bowls and start using
            this very organic product. <br><br>
            “After completing my Masters in Business Administration in 2017, I
            went on to work with a corporate company. I quit that job within one
            year because I wanted to work at a place that empowered the
            underprivileged. So I joined a social enterprise that worked with
            women in slums to make sustainable sanitary pads,” says the 26-
            year-old. <br><br>
            However, a visit to a coconut oil mill in Thrissur gave her the much-
            needed inspiration for her business.

              <h3 class="card-title" style="font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;font-weight: bold;">Why Only Cocconut?</h3>
              <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif">“Coconuts are a versatile crop, where every part can be utilized. But I
                noticed that the coconut shells were being discarded. Researching
                further, I understood that a few businesses use them to make
                activated charcoal, else they’re burned as fuel. Earlier, several
                artisans around Kerala used the shells to make ladles for serving
                food. Today, these products don’t find much value and the artisans
                practicing the craft have also reduced,” says Maria. <br><br>
                This led to the launch of a homegrown brand named Thenga, which
                means coconut, that has sold over 8,000 coconut shell-based
                products.</p>

              <h3 class="card-title" style="font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;font-weight: bold;">Earning from Waste</h3>
              <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif">In 2019, once Maria decided to sell coconut-shell based products,
                she spoke to artisans and experts who were making its byproducts.
                <br><br>
                She spent a few months understanding how the shells were sorted
                and how the final product is made.
                “I learnt that to make products from coconut shells certain
                machinery was required. This is mainly to scrub the outer and inner
                parts of the shell to give it a smooth finish,” says Maria. <br><br>
                However,she did not want to put in a large investment on
                purchasing machinery just for doing a trial run. This is when her 65-
                year-old father, Kuriakose Varoo, stepped in to help. Being a retired
                mechanical engineer, he knew what was needed to make a low-cost
                version of the machine.

              <h3 class="card-title" style="font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;font-weight: bold;">Learning Process</h3>
              <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif">To understand the design of the sanding wheel, Varoo referred to
                videos on YouTube and replicated the design with low-cost
                alternatives. “By purchasing the spare parts at a hardware store, my
                father recreated the sanding machines required to smoothen the
                inner and outer parts of the coconut shell within a few days. He
                recycled a handheld drill that was in our home and made different
                fittings such as a buffer and disc sander. My mother, Jolly Kuriakose,
                also helped by sourcing various sizes of coconut shells from our
                backyard and an oil mill nearby,” says Maria, adding that she spent
                this time reaching out to businesses who were willing to buy bowls
                made of coconut shells from her. <br><br>
                After identifying a few businesses, whom she did not wish to name,
                Maria made a few bowls at home. As an added advantage, she also
                printed business logos on them.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title" style="font-family: 'Comfortaa', cursive;font-weight: bold;">Production</h3>
                <p class="card-text" style="font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif">The artisans had the machinery and only needed to be briefed on
                    what kind of shells to use to maintain the size of the bowls and not
                    use any chemical-based product for adding the glossy finish. <br><br>
                    “The laser printing was done by a third party company that prints on
wooden products. As the final step, the shells were polished with
coconut oil instead of chemical-based products like varnish,” says
Maria.
<br><br>

                    With their help, Maria was able to take on more orders and expand
                    the range of available products. By the end of 2020, Thenga had four
                    sizes of bowl, the smallest one being 150ml priced at Rs 250 and the
                    largest being 900 ml used for serving salads priced at Rs 950. They
                    also introduced teacups, candles, cutlery, and hanging planters.</p>
