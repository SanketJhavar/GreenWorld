           <h2> 3) The Plastic Unfriendly Hotel</h2>
           <p>
Focusing on their environmental impact, the Hotel Andaluz maintains that it
can provide both high quality and environmentally sustainable service. To
emphasize their focus on the environment, the opening pages of their guests’
compendium include a section titled “Green By Design: Top Ten Reasons”.
Three of these relate to plastic reduction and recycling efforts.
With such a long history in the area, Hotel Andaluz was operating before the
rise of single-use plastic items and they continue to find most disposable
plastic items unnecessary in the service they provide for visitors.
Hotel Andaluz is mainly taking the following efforts to reduce their plastic
use.</p>
<p>
1) Non-single-use bottled water in their guests’ rooms Providing non-single-
use bottled water in their rooms means that the hotel can reduce the amount
of plastic waste generated. The water, in non-single-use glass bottles, is also
locally sourced as a part of the hotel’s other sustainability initiatives.</p>
<p>
2) Recycling bins are placed in each room, accompanied by a waste
management information card. Thus, guests are encouraged to become
knowledgeable about and participate in the hotel’s recycling and waste
reduction programs</p>
<p>
3) Bulk/refillable amenities in the guests’ rooms The highlight of their plastic
reduction program is their bulk/refillable amenities in each of the guests’
rooms. Fixed to the walls, four bottles in the bathrooms dispense shampoo,
conditioner, body wash, and lotion. Guests, therefore, have plenty of each
toiletry without having the unnecessary single-use plastic packaging used in
most other hotels. Eliminating the need for small plastic bottles can
significantly reduce the amount of plastic used in the hospitality industry.</p>
